# Three-Tier Distributed Web-Based Application

This project involves creating a three-tier web-based application using servlets and JSP technology on a Tomcat server to interact with a MySQL database via JDBC. The application manages a suppliers/parts/jobs/shipments database and includes user authentication and various user interfaces for different roles.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Implemented user authentication and dynamic SQL execution for root and client-level users.
- **GUI Design:** Designed a GUI front-end for executing DDL and DML commands with real-time results display.
- **Data Entry Forms:** Designed data entry forms for inserting records into the database using prepared statements.
- **Accountant Reports:** Created accountant-level reports executed via remote stored procedures using the CallableStatement interface.
